# CS50 Lecture Programs & Expanded Projects

This repository contains my solutions to lecture programs from the CS50 course, as well as expanded and modified versions of some of the projects. The CS50 course is a renowned computer science course offered by Harvard, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, web development, and more.

## Introduction

This repository is split into two main sections:
1. **Lecture Programs**: Programs written during the lectures to practice core concepts.
2. **Expanded Projects**: Projects from the course that have been expanded or modified with additional features and improvements.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
cs50-projects/
│
├── lectures/
│   ├── lecture1/
│   ├── lecture2/
│   └── ...
│
└── projects/
    ├── project1-expanded/
    ├── project2-expanded/
    └── ...
```

- **Lectures**: Contains the source code for programs covered in the CS50 lectures, organized by lecture number.
- **Projects**: Contains expanded and modified versions of the CS50 problem set projects, adding extra features, optimizations, or different approaches.

## Projects

### Example Expanded Projects

1. **Project 1: Expanded Caesar Cipher**
   - Expanded to support multiple alphabets and non-ASCII characters.
   - Added an option for decrypting messages.
   
2. **Project 2: Advanced Cash Calculator**
   - Supports multiple currencies.
   - Includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter.

(Expand on the specific features and improvements you've added in each project.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs50-projects.git
   cd cs50-projects
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```bash
   cd projects/project1-expanded
   ```

3. Compile or run the program (language-dependent):
   ```bash
   # For C programs
   make program_name
   ./program_name
   ```

## Usage

Each program comes with instructions on how to use it. For more details, refer to the README in the respective project folder.
